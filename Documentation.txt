------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Instructions:
    END: end marks down the end of a code block (similar to '}' character in C like languages). Code blocks start with
        special instructions such as if, switch, while and for loops. On if chains, the code block is separated by elif,
        meaning there is only 1 end keyword for the whole chain, and elif will act as '} else if () {'


    IF: Similar to most programming languages, if the condition is met, it will execute the next code block


    ELIF: Similar to python, if the new condition is met, and the previous conditions on the if chain were false, it
        will execute the next code block


    ELSE: similar to most programming languages, if none of the previous conditions were true, it will execute the next
        code block


    FOR: loops threw the next code block a fixed number of times. The first argument is the starting value, the second
        value is the end, and the third (optional) is the step that is added to the first value at the end of each
        iteration. It evaluates the expression at the start of each iteration, and if the first value is greater or
        equal than the end it will stop.


    WHILE: similar to most programming languages, while the condition is true it will execute the next code block.


    SWITCH: Strictly compares equality between the given value and other pre-defined values on CASE statements. It
        creates a hash table with the hash function: order all the inputs, then offset every one with the value of the
        smallest argument (arg-min(args)). and put them directly on a LUT (DW list). Then check if the entry is inside
         the bounds of the table and get the address of the code to execute. If no DEFAULT statements are defined, the
         default will be to do nothing and just ignores the switch. The unpopulated parts of the list will be programmed
         to the default case.


    CASE: Adds new cases to the current SWITCH statement. The provided cases will be linked to the position of the CASE
        statement inside the SWITCH code block. Note that EXIT are required to stop the next CASE from being executed.


    DEFAULT: Adds a default case to the current SWITCH statement. That default case will be linked with all the empty
        entries on the switch hash table. If no default statement is provided it will be assumed to exist and be empty.
        Note that EXIT are required to stop the next CASE from being executed.


    EXIT: Known as 'break' in most programming languages. It stops executing the current loop or switch statement.


    SKIP: Known as 'continue' in most programming languages. It stops executing the current iteration on a loop, runs
        the final statement, and branches back to the start of the next iteration.


    DEFINE: Defines a macro to be used instead of another operand. That macro is prefixed with '@' character. Can
        replace single word operands, and same macro cannot be reassigned in later parts of the program.


    LCAL: Calls a function using urcl++'s calling convention. It needs the library function's name, and inside parenthesis,
          the arguments (if it requires arguments). At the end of the file, you can find more about urcl++'s calling convention.


    TEMP: temp is more of a header than instruction, but it can be used as both. It adds registers to the list of
        registers it can be used during compile-time to translate and simplify code


    INST: Defines how an instruction should work for the compiler. It takes the opcode and all the types of the operands
        that make up the instruction. There are currently 7 types: 'REG', 'IMM', 'WB', 'MEM', 'LOC', 'ANY', 'IO'.

        REG: means it must be a register

        IMM: means it must be a literal value such as an immediate value, char, label (any value known at compile time)

        WB: means it must be a register to be written to

        MEM: means it must be a memory (RAM) location

        LOC: means it must be a program (ROM) location
            (Note: if the program is RUN RAM then it's a RAM location that should contain instructions)

        IO: means it must be a port (port number or port name)

        ANY: means it can be any of the above (except IO for safety reasons)
            (Note: it should not be possible to use port address (name or number) to be used as literals to avoid quirks
             and unpredictability.
                   Despite some emulators (at date of V2.0) being able to do so, in V2.0 and below it's not supported)

Floats and fixed point in Immediate values:
    TODO

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operand Shorthands:
    Operand Completion:
        Sometimes repetitive information can be omitted, and that is the case for automatic operand completing.
        Here is an example to illustrate how it works: INC R1 R1, it's rare to increment a register to other value
        other than itself.
        So it would make sense to have INC R1 be valid. But what about 3 operand instructions?
        Take the example: ADD R1 R1 R2
        In this case we can also omit the repeated source, making it ADD R1 R2.

    General Rule: If n-1 operands are presented on an n operand instruction, then the first operand will be repeated on
                  the output code.

    Pointers:
        In C you can use * operator to reference the value pointed by a variable.
        We adopted the [] operator for this matter.
        Inside the [] there can be a value. you can also append [] one after the other to have a pointer of a pointer.
        There are 2 distinct cases: when [] is used to write to, and when [] is used when reading its value.
        When writing, [] cannot be stacked multiple times to extend its logic multiple times.

        Reading:
            ADD R1 R2 R3[R4] will be compiled to
            ADD temp R3 R4
            LOD temp temp
            ADD R1 R2 temp

        Writing:
            ADD R1[] R2 R3 will be compiled to
            ADD temp R2 R3
            STR R1 temp

    Note: Currently these 2 features cannot be used at the same time. using [] to write and operand shorthand collides.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recursive Instructions:
    In higher level languages, one can have multiple statements and expressions in the same line.
    Despite being an assembly like language, we brought this feature to URCL++. Here is how it works:
    You can use the output of another expression directly as an input to another instruction, without needing to save it
    explicitly to a register/variable.

    (code in C):
        int temp = a - 69
        int output = b + a

        can be simply:

        int output = b + (a - 3)    // parenthesis are redundant and can be removed

    next is the same process but in urcl++
        SUB R5 R1 69    // variable a is R1 and temp is R5
        ADD R3 R5 R2    // variable b is R2 and output is R3

        can be simply:

        ADD R3 R2 (SUB R1 69)

    We just used the result of the instruction SUB R1 69 as operand on the ADD instruction.
    Notice that the destination operand is not present on the instruction inside parenthesis, as there's no need for it.
    The compiler will just find a temporary register to be used in that step process of saving the value.
    The compiler will NOT use the stack to store this temporary value as memory operations tend to be slow.
    Next versions will allow the stack to be used if the user didn't define enough temporary registers.
    In current V2.0 it provides an error saying not enough temporary registers were defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calling Convention:
    The function to be called must start with a label (equal to the name of the function), and end with a RET, or it can
    be alternatively replaced with its equivalent translation: POP PC or DEC SP SP; LOD PC SP
    When calling the function the caller must ensure the following (in this order):
        1: Pushing all the registers that are going to be used by the function, that are not output registers
        2: Pushing the function arguments in reverse order (1st argument is the last to be pushed). Skip if no arguments
        3: CAL to the label (cal = PSH PC; JMP .lib_func) or expanded as (STR SP PC; INC SP SP; JMP .lib_func)
        4: POP all args from the stack (or just subtract the number of arguments from the stack pointer SP)
        5: POP all used registers that are not output registers in reverse order
    After this, the outputs should be in the first registers (from R1 counting up)

    WARNINGS: No register outside the designated area (between R1 to Rn, n being number of used registers) should be
              written to, in order to avoid bugs.
              Put the headers on your library functions in order for the compiler to call the function correctly

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Library function Headers:
    OUTS: Specifies how many outputs the function will have

    OPS: Specifies how many arguments the function expects

    REG: Specifies how many registers total will be used (modified/written)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Error messages:
    All messages come with the line and the character that the error was found. If the error is generated at line -1 and
     character -1 then it's an error of the compiler (and possibly the user's code too). Please report the Bug.
     These index numbers often are at the end of the token instead of the beginning.

    List of all possible error messages and quick fixes:

        Illegal Char <>:
            means there is a char not supported by the compiler or a char that doesn't have a token associated with it.
            try removing that character

        Invalid Char <>:
            means that the character in between '' is either multiple characters or an unsupported char.
            try removing that character

        Invalid literal for imm value:
            means that the float standard presented is not one of the following: 16, 32, 64
            all the floats represented are in the IEEE-754 format. 16 is half precision, 32 is single precision, 64 is double precision.

        Unknown port name -> means that the port name/number is not supported by the official urcl documentation

        Unknown library function:
            means that a library function was referenced by its name and location on the files, but it was not found by the compiler. Try checking for typo or if it's on the right path

        Unknown library name:
            means that a library function was referenced by its name and location on the files, but it was not found by the compiler.
            Try checking for typo or if it's on the right path
            It can also be a function instead of a library

        Unknown instruction name:
            means that the compiler didn't find the definition of that instruction. This may be because the inst library was renamed, moved or deleted.
            In case of user made custom instructions it means that it wasn't defined at the time it was referenced.

        Missing closing quote:
            means that either ' or " were put but the ending pair was not found within the same line.
            Try checking if there is an accidental newLine (enter) or if the ' or " char was a typo.

        Keyword expected:
            means that the compiler was expecting a word while parsing but found another type of token.
            try making sure that the syntax and grammar of that line is correct.

        Symbol <> expected:
            means that the compiler was expecting a symbol while parsing but found another type of token.
            try making sure that the syntax and grammar of that line is correct.

        Token expected, found <> instead:
            means that the compiler was expecting a token while lexing but found nothing.
            try making sure that the syntax of that line is correct.

        Operand expected, found <> instead:
            means that the compiler was expecting an operand while parsing but found a type of token that can't be an operand.
            try making sure that the syntax and grammar of that line is correct

        Instruction <> takes <> operands but got <>:
            means that the instruction was defined as having a different number of operands than those presented.
            This error sometimes comes with other errors as the parser fails to parse some operand cause of another error and so it also fails in another section of the code.
            try fixing the other errors first if that happens.
            It can also happen due to a custom instruction being defined incorrectly.

        Invalid operand type '<>' for Instruction <>:
            means that the type of the operand given doesn't match the valid types on its definition.
            This error sometimes comes with other errors as the parser fails to parse some operand cause of another error and so it also fails in another section of the code.
            try fixing the other errors first if that happens.
            If the instructions is a custom instruction, then check its definition.
            Check the order of operands, as some instructions are not commutative.

        Wrong operand type '<>' used, '<>' expected:
            means that the type of the operand given doesn't match the valid types on its definition.
            This error sometimes comes with other errors as the parser fails to parse some operand cause of another error and so it also fails in another section of the code.
            try fixing the other errors first if that happens.
            If the instructions is a custom instruction, then check its definition.
            Check the order of operands, as some instructions are not commutative.

        Duplicate Case '<>' used:
            means that on SWITCH instruction, there are 2 CASE, that share the same value.
            try picking between them, and remove the duplicated.

        Duplicate Default used:
            means that default instruction was used more than 1 time on a single switch.
            try picking between them, and remove the duplicated default.

        Duplicate macro "<>" used:
            means that there were presented 2 definitions to the same macro.
            try picking between them, and remove one of them.

        Duplicate label "<>" used:
            means that the compiler found 2 labels with the same name.
            try picking between them, and remove one of them.

        Undefined macro '<>' used:
            means that the compiler found a macro that wasn't defined before.
            try defining it before usage, or remove it.

        EXIT/SKIP must be used inside a loop:
            means that either EXIT/SKIP were used without them being inside a loop's scope.
            try removing them or defining a loop. (there may be an extra END that is closing the loop before that instruction).

        ELSE/ELIF must come after "IF" instruction:
            means that the compiler found an ELSE or an ELIF before an IF instruction.
            try removing them. (there may be an extra END that is closing the if chain before that instruction).

        Missing "END":
            means that the compiler was expecting an END keyword but the file ended before.
            try checking the blocks of code, or adding END at the end of the file.

        Not enough temporary registers defined:
            means that the compiler faced a situation where it needed more temporary registers than those defined previously.
            Define more temporary registers or unpack the expression using explicit registers instead.

        Error on file '<>':
            means that the compiler found one of the previous errors on a file that was imported earlier.
            try following the instructions of the error provided at the specified location.
